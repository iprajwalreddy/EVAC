# EVAC
This is a repository to run EVAC: Multi-scale V-net with Deep Feature CRF Layers for Brain Extraction

##Pre-requisites
This model depends on the implementation of the CRFasRNNLayer, which is from this repository : https://github.com/sadeepj/crfasrnn_keras
Please follow the instructions of that repo to make the necessary files before running this model.

Due to the constraints of the implemented CRFasRNNLayer, the model is limited to a Tensorflow version of 2.3.0, which will be edited later to remove this constraint.
